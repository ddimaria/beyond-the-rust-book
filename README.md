# Beyond the Rust Book

The [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is an incredible resource.  Combined with [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), a developer can learn quite about about the Rust programming language.  I created this repo for those of you who want examples on Rust concepts that go a bit deeper in some areas and delve into third-party crates for some common use cases.
