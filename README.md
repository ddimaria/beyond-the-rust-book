# Beyond the Rust Book

The [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is an incredible resource.  Combined with [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), a developer can learn quite about about the Rust programming language.  I created this repo for those of you who want examples on Rust concepts that go a bit deeper in some areas and delve into third-party crates for some common use cases.

## Lessons

* [Benchmark with Criterion and Cargo Flamegraph](lessons/benchmark-with-criterion-and-cargo-flamegraph/)

### Tokio Pub Sub

Build a small pubsub system with subscribers running on separate threads.  The publisher can send text messages to all subscribers, as well as signal them to gracefully shutdown.

### Create your own Async Mutex

Learn about an Async Mutex by creating your own.  This Mutex is heavily inspired by [Tokio's Mutex](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/struct.Mutex.html).

### Benchmark with Criterion and Cargo Flamegraph

Create a benchmark for the [Async Mutex](lessons/create-your-own-mutex/) we created and compare against Tokio's Mutex, Rust's std Mutex, and Parking Lot's Mutex and analyze the results.  Generate a flamegraph of the benchmarks.
